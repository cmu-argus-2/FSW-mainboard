Satellite State Management

======================

This module defines the operational states for the satellite, represented as constants, along with the corresponding
string representations. Each state indicates a distinct operational mode, with entry and exit criteria.

States:
    STARTUP: The initial state where hardware boot, diagnostics, and state recovery are performed.
    Burnwires are activated at the end of this phase.
    DETUMBLING: A state where the satellite reduces its angular momentum below a defined threshold.
    This state is active until stability is achieved or a timeout occurs.
    NOMINAL: The primary operational state where all systems, excluding payload, are fully functional,
    provided sufficient power levels are maintained.
    EXPERIMENT: This state is similar to NOMINAL with the activation of the Payload (OD). Given the high
    power draw, this state requires a high state of charge for opportunistic transitions.
    LOW_POWER: A power-conservation state entered when battery levels drop below a critical threshold.
    Non-essential systems are turned off, and the satellite resumes nominal operations upon recharging above a
    recovery threshold.
