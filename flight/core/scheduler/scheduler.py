"""
Core Scheduler Module for Argus. This module provides a simple event loop for running a set of concurrent tasks.
Each task is a coroutine, implemented as a generator in CircuitPython. The scheduler manages the execution of tasks,
scheduling, sleeping, and task prioritization.

Example Usage:
    async def application_loop():
        pass

    def run():
        loop = Loop()
        loop.schedule(100, application_loop)
        loop.run()

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        run()

    This provides a way for a coroutine to yield control back to the event loop.
    Returns an object whose __await__ method yields once. When awaited, it suspends
